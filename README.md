# 5amcommitment

## The Project

A website where you check in every morning and earn points for doing so. The earlier you check in, the more points you earn.

The site only has a homepage, with 2 parts:
- The checkin question. Something like "How much is 8 x 9?" (The purpose of the question is to make checking in a little laborious, so people don't just press a button and go back to sleep.)
- A monthly scoreboard.

This is the flow for the user:
1. The clock starts at 5am local time.
2. If you check in between 5am and 5:05am, you earn 100 points.
3. Every half an hour, the points decrease, until there are no points at 8am.
